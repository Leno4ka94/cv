  text: |
    I am Olena and my vocation is a designer and web developer. Of course, like most people, I did not immediately understand this. But time passed, I grew up and started looking for myself. 

    I first became interested in design, and then in frontend. Now I am moving in this direction and improving my knowledge. At the moment, I stopped at the development of static sites, namely based on Jekyll, but I am open to any cooperation.

    <span>I will be glad to meet you and work with you.</span>
